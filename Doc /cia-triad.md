# CIA Triad

## 🔐 CIA Triad

The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad is a foundational model in information security that defines the core objectives for protecting information systems and data. It provides a conceptual framework for identifying security requirements and guiding the design, implementation, and evaluation of security controls.

Confidentiality

Confidentiality refers to the protection of information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It ensures that sensitive data is accessible only to entities that have been properly authenticated and authorized. Common mechanisms used to enforce confidentiality include encryption, access control policies, and identity management systems.

Integrity

Integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. It protects information from unauthorized modification, deletion, or fabrication, whether accidental or malicious. Integrity is typically maintained through cryptographic hash functions, digital signatures, version control systems, and audit mechanisms.

Availability

Availability ensures that information systems and data remain accessible and usable upon demand by authorized users. This principle addresses resilience against system failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other disruptions. Availability is commonly achieved through redundancy, fault tolerance, regular backups, and continuous monitoring.

## Significance

The CIA Triad serves as a fundamental reference model for risk assessment and security architecture design, enabling organizations to balance security objectives against operational and performance constraints.
